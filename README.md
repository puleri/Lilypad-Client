# Lilypad Client
Lilypad is a an application which allows users upon authentication to create, update, read, and destroy
notes. The client side for the app is a single page application. Users are able to create an account,
sign in, change-password, and sign out-- all of which in order to protect user information.

## Technologies used
Technologies used include: Justinmind, Atom, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and an external API (link 
located below). This project was done entirely on a Macbook Pro. Research for the project was done
with peers, on W3, and on StackOverflow.

## Planning and Execution
Prior to coding the application, a plan was schedule was created in order to keep the production
flowing smoothly. Token authentication was created in the first phase of the project, followed by
the notes resource. At this point with a minimum viable project came testing and fixing
functionality of user-resource (notes) security. Finally came some basic styling and addition
of show/hide functionality-- allowing users to see more relevant information on the screen.

## Future development
In future iterations of the client, I would like users to be able to view notes index upon log-in and
to be able to edit notes by clicking on them rather than entering in a seperate box + note Id. Currently users
are required to input their id's which is tedious.
